% Math font settings for representing Concepts, Tokens etc.
% This in order to use two different script alphabets in the same document, 
% visually different from each other. 
% Define \mathcal as something that looks like the default calligraphic letters, 
% and \mathscr as a second script alphabet 

\usepackage[mathcal]{euscript}		% Calligraphic mathcal{O} for Ontology, W(orld) and (M)odel etc. 
                                    % Refer to http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/amsfonts/euscript.pdf
									% Note that, in fact, eucal and euscript are identical, except that they use different commands (\mathcal and \mathscr). By using euscript 
									% we only provide \mathscr{} and leave \mathcal{} from amsmath unchanged
\usepackage{pgothic}				% Used for modern gothic that has a readable S
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathgoth}{T1}{pgoth}{m}{n}	% Declaring the pgothic family as math alphabet
